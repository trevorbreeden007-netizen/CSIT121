            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This lab was my first go at hand coding HTML, let alone using the ins and outs of Microsoft Visual Studio Code. 
                At first I was a little lost, but the more I practiced the easier it got. I learned how the header, main, and 
                footer help organize the page to be more digestible. Lists and links are still a bit tricky, but I got them 
                to work. Overall this lab was very insightful, and it was good practice. I feel more comfortable with the basics.

                <li>How to set up and save HTML files</li>
                <li>How to create an HTML file and save it in the right folder</li>
                <li>How to use headings and lists correctly</li>

            My second lab with CSS! I have applied an external CSS file to style this page. 
        </p>

        <p id="special">
            This is an example of an ID selector.
        </p>

    </p>
           </p> This paragraph has <span class="highlight">two examples</span> of a class selector applied to different words. 
            class can be reused in multiple places. In this case, I used them to words using the 
            <span class="highlight">span tag.</span>
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned From Class</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>CSS is really fun to mess around with once you start to understand the basics.</li>
            <li>
                There are a lot of online resources. I like
