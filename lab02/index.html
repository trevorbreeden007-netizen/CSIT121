            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This lab was my first go at hand coding HTML. let alone using the ins and outs of Microsoft visual studios At first I was a little lost 
                but the more I practiced the easier it got. I learned how the header, main, and 
                footer help organize the pageto be more digestable Lists and links are still a bit tricky but I got them 
                to work. Overall this lab was very insightful and it was good practice and I feel more comfortable with the basics.
