    <h2>1. URL of the Website</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.mlb.com/orioles" target="_blank">https://www.mlb.com/orioles</a></p>

    <h2>2. Name of the Website</h2>
    <p>Baltimore Orioles Official Website, also the URL above.</p>

    <h2>3. Target Audience</h2>
    <p>The site targets baseball fans, especially Baltimore Orioles supporters, as well local community members interested in team updates and schedules.</p>

    <h2>4. Site Organization</h2>
    <p>The website uses a hierarchical structure. The top navigation bar organizes content by categories such as <strong>News</strong>, <strong>Scores</strong>, <strong>Schedule</strong>, <strong>Roster</strong>, and <strong>Tickets</strong>. Information is grouped with dropdown menus and easy navigation to its many subpages.</p>

    <h2>5. CRAP Design Principle Example</h2>
    <p>
      The website effectively applies the <strong>Alignment</strong> principle content is aligned consistently across the grid, keeping text and media neat and easy to scan. 
      It also uses <strong>Contrast</strong> (like a orange and black color palette) to emphasize headings and calls to action, creating a visually appealing balance.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Accessibility Audit Score</h2>
    <p>The Accessibility Checker Lighthouse shows the website scored a <strong>70</strong> out of 100.</p>

    <h2>7. Site Effectiveness</h2>
    <p>The Baltimore Orioles site supports user goals like as finding scores and checking the teams schedule. Important information about team updates and news is visible and organized.</p>

    <h2>8. Site Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Users for the site can perform tasks quickly thanks to consistent navigation menus, a search bar, and quick links to major features like “Tickets” and “Stats.” Loading times are fast, and menus are intuitive.</p>

    <h2>9. Engagement</h2>
    <p>The site is highly engaging with high-quality photos, videos, and a clean design that fits professional sports branding. It also connects fans with multimedia content and team updates, creating a pleasant experience.</p>

    <h2>10. Recommendation</h2>
    <p>One improvement would be to enhance text contrast in some areas (such as orange text on white backgrounds) to improve accessibility for users with visual impairments. Adding more alt text to decorative images could also improve accessibility scores.</p>
